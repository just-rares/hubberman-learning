This program creates an automated version that guides you though all the important steps.

## Features:
1. Random micro-rests
   - After 2 minutes of work, in the following minute, a 10 second break is recommended, chosen at random so it doesn't become predictible. In these 10 seconds, Hubberman suggests that doing nothing improves learning.

2. Intermitent rewards
   - TBD
  
3. Other features
   - TBD
